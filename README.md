# RSSA API

This project was originally created by Aru Bhoop as an API for [Lijie Guo's](https://github.com/freelilian) recommender system algorithms [(rssa_algs](https://github.com/freelilian/rssa_algs).) The code in the `src/algs/` is from the original algorithm project with minor changes (bug fixes and deployment related optimization.) Also, any major changes to the algorithm code that is reflected in the deployed API can be found in the _deploy\_v\_X\_X_ branch.

The Flask API and database content are curated for the [RSSA React](https://github.com/daz101/rssa-react) project.

Configuration and setup process for the algorithms and the front-end React project can be found in their respective repositories.
